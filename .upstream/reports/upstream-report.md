## Recommended Decision Vocabulary

- `ignore`: The upstream change does not affect this suite.
- `port`: Adapt the idea/checklist/template into the local skill suite.

- `defer`: Revisit in the next maintenance cycle.

## Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Read each relevant changed file.
- [ ] Decide `ignore`, `port`, `vendor`, or `defer` for each source.
- [ ] If porting, update local `SKILL.md`, `references/`, or `templates/` files.
- [ ] Run `python tools/check_skill_suite.py`.
- [ ] Update `SOURCE_NOTES.md` if attribution or adaptation scope changes.
